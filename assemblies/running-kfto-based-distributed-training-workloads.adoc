You can use the Kubeflow Training Operator (KFTO) and Kubeflow Training Operator Python Software Development Kit (KFTO SDK) to train a model in a variety of ways.

For example, you can fine-tune a model, configure a training job to use RDMA, configure a training job to use multiple nodes and multiple GPUs per node.
