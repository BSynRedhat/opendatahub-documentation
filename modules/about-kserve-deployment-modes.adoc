= About KServe deployment modes

KServe offers two deployment modes for serving models. The default mode, Knative Serverless, is based on the open-source Knative project and provides powerful autoscaling capabilities. It integrates with {org-name} OpenShift Serverless and {org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh. Alternatively, the KServe RawDeployment mode offers a more traditional deployment method with fewer dependencies.

Before you choose an option, understand how your initial configuration affects future deployments:

* *If you configure for Knative Serverless*: You can use both Knative Serverless and KServe RawDeployment modes.
* *If you configure for KServe RawDeployment only*: You can only use the KServe RawDeployment mode.

Use the following comparison to choose the option that best fits your requirements.

|===
|Criterion |`Knative Serverless` |`KServe RawDeployment`

|Default mode
|Yes
|No

|Recommended use case
|Most workloads.
|Custom serving setups or models that must remain active.

|Autoscaling
a|
* Scales up automatically based on request volume.
* Supports scaling down to zero when idle to save costs.
a|
* No built-in autoscaling; you can configure Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) on your deployment.
* Does not support scaling to zero by default, which might result in higher costs during periods of low traffic.

|Dependencies
a| 
* {org-name} OpenShift Serverless Operator
* {org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh
* Authorino. Only required only if you enable token authentication and external routes.
a|None; uses standard Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler`.

|Configuration flexibility
|Has some customization limitations inherited from Knative compared to raw Kubernetes deployments.
|Provides full control over pod specifications because it uses standard Kubernetes `Deployment` resources.

|Resource footprint
|Larger, due to the additional dependencies required for serverless functionality.
|Smaller.

|Setup complexity
|Might require additional configuration in setup and management. If Serverless is not already installed on the cluster, you must install and configure it.
|Requires a simpler setup with fewer dependencies.
