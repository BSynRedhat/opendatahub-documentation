= About KServe deployment modes

KServe offers two deployment modes for serving models. The default mode, *Knative Serverless*, is based on the open-source Knative project and provides powerful autoscaling capabilities. It integrates with {org-name} OpenShift Serverless and {org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh. Alternatively, the *KServe RawDeployment* mode offers a more traditional deployment method with fewer dependencies.

Your initial configuration has long-term implications: a setup for *Knative Serverless* allows you to use both modes, while a setup for only *KServe RawDeployment* limits you to that mode. Use the following comparison to choose the option that best fits your requirements.

|===
|Criterion |`Knative Serverless` |`KServe RawDeployment`

|Default mode
|Yes
|No

|Recommended use case
|Most workloads.
|Custom serving setups or models that must remain active.

|Autoscaling
a|
* Scales up automatically based on request volume.
* Supports scaling down to zero when idle to save costs.
a|
* No built-in autoscaling; you can configure Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) on your deployment.
* Does not support scaling to zero by default, which might result in higher costs during periods of low traffic.

|Dependencies
|Requires the {org-name} OpenShift Serverless Operator, {org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh, and Authorino.
|Does not require additional dependencies. Uses standard Kubernetes resources like `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Route`.

|Configuration flexibility
|Has customization limitations inherited from Knative, such as when mounting multiple volumes.
|Enables traditional pod configurations, such as mounting multiple volumes, which is not available using Knative.

|Resource footprint
|Larger, due to the additional dependencies required for serverless functionality.
|Smaller resource footprint compared to `Knative Serverless` mode.

|Setup complexity
a|
* Introduces additional complexity in setup and management.
* Might require manual configuration if Serverless is already installed on the cluster.
|Requires a simpler setup with fewer dependencies.
