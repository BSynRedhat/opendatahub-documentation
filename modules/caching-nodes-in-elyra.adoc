= Caching nodes in Elyra

[role='_abstract']
Elyra offers a feature within {productname-short} that allows you to cache components, or "nodes," within your data pipelines. When a pipeline component runs, Elyra stores its outputs by default. In subsequent runs, if Elyra detects that a particular component has already been executed and its inputs have not changed, it reuses the cached outputs instead of re-running the entire component. For more information about data science pipelines caching, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.22/html/working_with_data_science_pipelines/managing-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#overview-of-data-science-pipelines-caching_ds-pipelines[Overview of data science pipelines caching].
