* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
* You have existing notebook images in your deployment.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Notebook images*.

The *Notebook image settings* page appears. Previously imported notebook images are displayed. 
. Click the action menu (&#8942;) and select *Edit* from the list.
+
The *Update notebook image* dialog opens.
. From the *Accelerator identifier* list, select an identifier to set its accelerator as recommended with the notebook image.
. Click *Update*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the accelerator profile does not exist in your deployment, click *Create profile* on the row containing the relevant notebook image to create an accelerator profile as the image's recommended accelerator.
