= Configuring the CodeFlare Operator

[role='_abstract']
If you want to change the default configuration of the CodeFlare Operator for distributed workloads in {productname-short}, you can edit the associated config map.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform} with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]


.Procedure
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps*.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
. In the OpenShift console, click *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps*.
endif::[]

ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
. From the *Project* list, select *redhat-ods-applications*.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. From the *Project* list, select *odh*.
endif::[]

. Search for the *codeflare-operator-config* config map, and click the config map name to open the *ConfigMap details* page.

. Click the *YAML* tab to show the config map specifications.
. In the `*data*` > `*config.yaml*` > `*kuberay*` section, you can edit the following entries:
+
`*ingressDomain*`::
This configuration option is null (`ingressDomain: ""`) by default.
This option should remain null unless the Ingress Controller is not running on OpenShift.
{productname-short} uses this value to generate the dashboard and client routes for every Ray Cluster, as shown in the following examples:
+
.Example dashboard and client routes
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
ray-dashboard-_<clustername>_-_<namespace>_._<your.ingress.domain>_
ray-client-_<clustername>_-_<namespace>_._<your.ingress.domain>_
----
+
`*mTLSEnabled*`::
This configuration option is enabled (`mTLSEnabled: true`) by default.
When this option is enabled, the Ray Cluster pods create certificates that are used for mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS), a form of mutual authentication, between Ray Cluster nodes.
When this option is enabled, Ray clients cannot connect to the Ray head node unless they download the generated certificates from the `ca-secret-_<cluster_name>_` secret, generate the necessary certificates for mTLS communication, and then set the required Ray environment variables.
The CodeFlare SDK provides the following functions to simplify the authentication process for Ray clients:
+
.Example Ray client authentication code
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
from codeflare_sdk import generate_cert

generate_cert.generate_tls_cert(cluster.config.name, cluster.config.namespace)
generate_cert.export_env(cluster.config.name, cluster.config.namespace)
----

+
`*rayDashboardOauthEnabled*`::
This configuration option is enabled (`rayDashboardOAuthEnabled: true`) by default.
When this option is enabled, {productname-short} places an OpenShift OAuth proxy in front of the Ray Cluster head node.
Users must then authenticate via their OpenShift cluster login credentials when accessing the Ray Dashboard through the browser.
If the user wants to access the Ray Dashboard via the Ray `JobSubmissionClient` class or in some other programmatic way, they must set an authorization header as part of their request, as shown in the following example:
+
.Example authorization header
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
{Authorization: "Bearer _<your-openshift-token>_"}
----

. To save your changes, click *Save*.
. To apply your changes, delete the pod:
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
.. Find the *codeflare-operator-manager-_<pod-id>_* pod.
.. Click the options menu (&#8942;) for that pod, and then click *Delete Pod*.
 The pod restarts with your changes applied.


.Verification
Check the status of the *codeflare-operator-manager* pod, as follows:

ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Workloads* -> *Deployments*.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
. In the OpenShift console, click *Workloads* -> *Deployments*.
endif::[]

. Search for the *codeflare-operator-manager* deployment, and then click the deployment name to open the deployment details page.
. Click the *Pods* tab.
When the status of the *codeflare-operator-manager-_<pod-id>_* pod is *Running*, the pod is ready to use.
To see more information about the pod, click the pod name to open the pod details page, and then click the *Logs* tab.
