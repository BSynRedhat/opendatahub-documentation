= Creating project-scoped resources as administrator

[role='_abstract']
Users can access _global resources_ in all projects, but can access _project-scoped resources_ within the specified project only.

Cluster administrators can create the following project-scoped resources in any project:

* Workbench images
* Hardware profiles
* Accelerator profiles
* Model-serving runtimes for KServe

The name of each resource must be unique within the project.

.Prerequisites

* You can access the {openshift-platform} console as a cluster administrator.

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-odh/#customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]


.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console as a cluster administrator.
. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *Search*.
. In the *Resources* list, search for the relevant resource type, as follows:

* For workbench images, search for `ImageStream`.
* For hardware profiles, search for `HardwareProfile`.
* For accelerator profiles, search for `AcceleratorProfile`.
* For serving runtimes, search for `Template`. 
From the resulting list, find a template that has the `objects.kind` specification set to `ServingRuntime`. 

ifdef::upstream[]
. From the *Project* list, select the `opendatahub` project to display a list of global resources of the specified type.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
. From the *Project* list, select the `redhat-ods-applications` project to display a list of global resources of the specified type.
endif::[]

. Optional: If you want to maintain a global version and project-scoped version of the same resource, duplicate the global resource, as follows:

.. Select the resource in the list.
.. Click the *YAML* tab.
.. Select and copy the entire YAML content.
.. Click *Cancel*.
.. From the toolbar, click the *+* icon to open the *Import YAML* page.
.. Paste the copied YAML content into the code area.
.. Edit the `metadata.name` value to assign a unique name.
.. Click *Create*.

. Change the resource scope from global to project-scoped, as follows:
.. Select the resource in the list.
.. Click the *YAML* tab.
.. Edit the `metadata.namespace` value to replace the global project name with the name of an existing project.
.. Optional: Edit the `metadata.name` value to change the name of the project-scoped resource.
The resource name must be unique within the project.
.. Click *Save*.  



.Verification
. Log in to the {productname-short} console as a regular user.
. Verify that the project-scoped resource is shown in the specified project only:
