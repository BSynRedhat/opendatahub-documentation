= Creating the training job

[role='_abstract']
Before you can use a training job to tune a model, you must create the training job. 
The example training job in this section is based on the IBM and Hugging Face tuning example provided link:https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/tree/main/examples/prompt_tuning_twitter_complaints[here]. 


.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform} with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project. 
For information about how to create a project, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project. 
For information about how to create a project, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project].
endif::[]

* You have Admin access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have Admin access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you Admin access.

* You have access to a model.
* You have access to data that you can use to train the model.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the OpenShift CLI as shown in the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----

. Create a training job, as follows:
.. Create a YAML file named `config_trainingjob.yaml`.
.. Add the following `ConfigMap` object definition:
+
[source]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-config-trainingjob
  namespace: kfto
data:
  config.json: |
    {
      "model_name_or_path": "bigscience/bloom-560m",
      "training_data_path": "/data/input/twitter_complaints.json",
      "output_dir": "/data/output/tuning/bloom-twitter",
      "num_train_epochs": 10.0,
      "per_device_train_batch_size": 4,
      "gradient_accumulation_steps": 4,
      "learning_rate": 1e-05,
      "response_template": "\n### Label:",
      "dataset_text_field": "output",
      "use_flash_attn": false
    }

----
.. Replace the example namespace value `kfto` with the name of your project.
.. Edit the following parameters of the training job:
... In the `model_name_or_path` field, specify the name of the pre-trained model.
... In the `training_data_path` field, specify the path to the training data that you set in the `training_data.yaml` ConfigMap.
... In the `output_dir` field, specify the output directory for the model.
... In the `num_train_epochs` field, specify the number of epochs for training. 
In this example, the training job is set to run 10 times.
... In the `per_device_train_batch_size` field, specify the batch size; that is, how many data set examples to process together.
In this example, the training job processes 4 examples at a time.
... In the `gradient_accumulation_steps` field, specify the number of gradient accumulation steps.
... In the `learning_rate` field, specify the learning rate for the training.
... In the `response_template` field, specify the template formatting for the response.
... In the `dataset_text_field` field, specify the dataset field for training output. This field is set in the `training_data.yaml` config map.
... In the `use_flash_attn` field, specify whether to use flash attention.
.. Save your changes in the `config_trainingjob.yaml` file.
.. Apply the configuration to create the `my-config-trainingjob` object:
+
[source]
----
$ oc apply -f config_trainingjob.yaml
----

. Create the training data, as follows:
.. Create a YAML file named `training_data.yaml`.
.. Add the following `ConfigMap` object definition:
