= Deleting a pipeline version

[role='_abstract']
You can delete specific versions of a pipeline when you no longer require them. Deleting a default pipeline version automatically changes the default pipeline version to the next most recent version. If no pipeline versions exist, the pipeline persists without a default version. 

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active and available pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Pipelines*.
+
The *Pipelines* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project that contains a version of a pipeline that you want to delete.
. On the row containing the pipeline, click *Expand* (image:images/rhoai-expand-icon.png[]).

[NOTE]

You can delete multiple pipeline versions simultaneously. To do this, on the row containing each pipeline version that you want to delete, select the checkbox. After you have selected the versions you want to delete, click the action menu (&#8942;) next to the *Import pipeline* dropdown, and select *Delete* from the list.
--
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the project version that you want to delete and click *Delete pipeline version*.
+
The *Delete pipeline version* dialog opens.
. Enter the name of the pipeline version in the text field to confirm that you intend to delete it.
. Click *Delete*.

.Verification
* The pipeline version that you deleted no longer appears on the *Pipelines* page or on the *Pipelines* tab on the data science project details page for the relevant project.
