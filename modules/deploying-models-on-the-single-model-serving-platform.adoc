= Deploying models on the single model serving platform

[role='_abstract']
When you have enabled the _single model serving platform_ (which uses the KServe component of {productname-short}), you can enable the Caikit-TGIS runtime that this platform uses and start to deploy models on the platform. 

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
* You have installed KServe.
* You have enabled the single model serving platform.
* You have created a data science project.
* To use the Caikit-TGIS runtime, you have converted your model to Caikit format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/blob/main/demo/kserve/built-tip.md#bootstrap-process[Converting Hugging Face Hub models to Caikit format] in the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/tree/main[caikit-tgis-serving] repository.
* You know the folder path for the data connection that you want the model to access.

* If you want to use graphics processing units (GPUs) with your model server, you have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}. See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/enabling-gpu-support_install[Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}].

.Procedure
. Enable the Caikit-TGIS runtime as follows:
.. In the left menu of the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Serving runtimes*.
.. On the *Serving runtimes* page, set the *Caikit TGIS ServingRuntime for KServe* runtime to *Enabled*. 
. In the left menu, click *Data Science Projects*.
. Click the name of the project that you want to deploy a model in.
. In the *Models and model servers* section, perform one of the following actions:
+
--
* If you see a *​​Single model serving platform* tile, click *Deploy model* on the tile. 
* If you do not see any tiles, click the *Deploy model* button.
--
+
The *Deploy model* dialog opens.
. Configure properties for deploying your model as follows:
.. In the *Model name* field, enter a unique name for the model that you are deploying.
.. In the *Serving runtime* field, select *Caikit TGIS ServingRuntime for KServe*.
.. From the *Model framework* list, select *caikit*.
.. In the *Number of model replicas to deploy* field, specify a value.
.. From the *Model server size* list, select a value.
.. To specify the location of your model, perform one of the following sets of actions:
+
--
* *To use an existing data connection*
... Select *Existing data connection*.
... From the *Name* list, select a data connection that you previously defined.
... In the *Folder path* field, enter the folder path that contains the model in your specified data source.

* *To use a new data connection*
... To define a new data connection that your model can access, select *New data connection*.
... In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the data connection.
... In the *Access key* field, enter the access key ID for your S3-compatible object storage provider.
... In the *Secret key* field, enter the secret access key for the S3-compatible object storage account that you specified.
... In the *Endpoint* field, enter the endpoint of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
... In the *Region* field, enter the default region of your S3-compatible object storage account.
... In the *Bucket* field, enter the name of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
... In the *Folder* path field, enter the folder path in your S3-compatible object storage that contains your data file.
--
.. Click *Deploy*.

.Verification
* Confirm that the deployed model is shown in the *Models and model servers* section of your project, and on the *Model Serving* page of the dashboard with a check mark in the *Status* column.
