= Deploying models by using the single model serving platform

[role='_abstract']
On the single model serving platform, each model is deployed from its own model server. This helps you to deploy, monitor, scale, and maintain LLMs that require increased resources.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
If you want to use a self-signed certificate to deploy a model from S3-compatible storage, the single model serving platform (which uses KServe) requires additional configuration. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution article link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7053013[How to use self-signed certificates with KServe^].

Alternatively, you can disable SSL authentication for KServe. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution article link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7047512[How to skip the validation of SSL for KServe^].
