= Deploying models by using the single model serving platform

[role='_abstract']
On the single model serving platform, each model is deployed from its own model server. This helps you to deploy, monitor, scale, and maintain LLMs that require increased resources.

IMPORTANT: The single model serving platform does not support self-signed certificates. Therefore, to deploy a model from S3 storage, you need to follow a workaround to disable SSL authentication. For more information, see the following Red Hat Solution article: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7047512[How to skip the validation of SSL for KServe^].
