//OpenShift provides access to certain hardware resources such as Habana AI accelerators, NICs, and other devices through the device plugin framework. Configuring and managing OpenShift nodes with these hardware resources require configuring multiple software components and libraries.

//Since this is time consuming and error prone, the HabanaAI Operator is used with the Kernel Module Management Operator. This automates the management of all HabanaAI software components needed to provision AI accelerators within OpenShift cluster, from the drivers to the respective monitoring metrics.

//How a data scientist can select Habana’s notebook image from the Jupyter notebook spawner. This allows the data scientist to use the libraries and software provided by Habana to efficiently use Gaudi devices from their notebooks. 

//This option will be available in multiple places in the UI, such as when creating a workbench, serving a model, serving a notebook. The HPUs are allocated to a single node to obtain optimal performance.  he recommended accelerator profile is the default option within the accelerator profile dropdown. The data scientist can select 0 HPUs. They don’t have to use accelerators.
