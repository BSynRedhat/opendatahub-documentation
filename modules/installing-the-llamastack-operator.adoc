= Installing the Llama Stack Operator

You can install the Llama Stack Operator on your {openshift-platform} cluster by applying the latest release manifest from the upstream repository.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges.
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/{osd-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (OpenShift Dedicated)^] or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/{rosa-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS)^].
endif::[]
* Your infrastructure supports GPU-enabled instance types, for example, `g4dn.xlarge` on AWS.
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery operator and NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery operator^] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery and NVIDIA GPU Operators. For more information, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
endif::[]
* You have created a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` resource instance on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-nfd.html#Procedure[Installing the Node Feature Discovery operator and creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
* You have created a `ClusterPolicy` resource instance with default values on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-gpu-ocp.html#create-the-clusterpolicy-instance[Creating the ClusterPolicy instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.

.Procedure

. Open a new terminal window.
. Log in to your {openshift-platform} cluster from the CLI:
.. In the upper-right corner of the OpenShift web console, click your user name and select *Copy login command*.
.. After you have logged in, click *Display token*.
.. Copy the *Log in with this token* command and paste it into the terminal where you are using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login --token=__<token>__ --server=__<openshift_cluster_url>__
----

. Set the Llama Stack Operator repository URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LLAMASTACK_REPO=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llamastack/llama-stack-k8s-operator
----

. Apply the operator manifest to your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f $LLAMASTACK_REPO/main/release/operator.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the Llama Stack Operator pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=llama-stack-k8s-operator -n llama-stack-k8s-operator-system -f
----
+
You should see log entries indicating that the Llama Stack Operator has started successfully. For example:
+
[source,text]
----
2025-06-11T16:36:12Z INFO setup starting manager
2025-06-11T16:36:13Z INFO controller-runtime.metrics Metrics server is starting to listen {"addr": ":8080"}
2025-06-11T16:36:13Z INFO Starting Controller {"controller": "llamastackdistribution", ...}
----
+
If you see log messages showing that the manager, metrics server, or controller are starting or running, the Llama Stack Operator is operating as expected.
+
[NOTE]
====
The log output might differ depending on the Operator version and your environment.
