= Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator integration

[role='_abstract']
To accelerate your high-performance deep learning (DL) models, you can integrate Intel Gaudi AI accelerators in {productname-short}. A workbench image for Intel Gaudi accelerators is not included in {productname-short}. Instead, you must create and configure a custom notebook to enable Intel Gaudi AI support.

You can use Intel Gaudi AI accelerators in an Amazon EC2 DL1 instance on OpenShift. Therefore, your OpenShift platform must support EC2 DL1 instances. 
Before you can use your Intel Gaudi AI accelerators, you must enable them in your OpenShift environment and configure an accelerator profile for each device. When enabled and fully configured with a custom notebook, Intel Gaudi AI accelerators are available to your data scientists when they create a workbench instance or serve a model. 

To identify the Intel Gaudi AI accelerators present in your deployment, use the `lspci` utility. For more information, see link:https://linux.die.net/man/8/lspci[lspci(8) - Linux man page].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `lspci` utility indicates that Intel Gaudi AI accelerators are present in your deployment, it does not necessarily mean that the devices are ready to use.
