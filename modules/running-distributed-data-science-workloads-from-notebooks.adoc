= Running distributed data science workloads from notebooks

[role='_abstract']
To run a distributed data science workload from a notebook, you must first provide the link to your Ray cluster image and to your Local Queue.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created the required Kueue resources as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_distributed_workloads[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads].
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-with-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].
* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench that is running one of the default notebook images, for example, the *Standard Data Science* notebook.
See the table in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/creating-and-importing-notebooks_notebooks#notebook-images-for-data-scientists_notebooks[Notebook images for data scientists] for a complete list of default notebook images.

* You have launched your notebook server and logged in to Jupyter.

.Procedure
. Download the demo notebooks provided by the CodeFlare SDK.
The demo notebooks provide guidelines for how to use the CodeFlare stack in your own notebooks.
+
To access the demo notebooks, clone the `codeflare-sdk` repository as follows:

.. In the JupyterLab interface, click *Git > Clone a Repository*.
.. In the "Clone a repo" dialog, enter `https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk.git` and then click *Clone*.
The `codeflare-sdk` repository is listed in the left navigation pane.
. Run a distributed workload job as shown in the following example:
.. In the JupyterLab interface, in the left navigation pane, double-click *codeflare-sdk*.
.. Double-click *demo-notebooks*, and then double-click *guided-demos*.
.. Update each example demo notebook as follows:
** Replace the links to the example community image with a link to your Ray cluster image.
** If you have not configured a default local queue as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_distributed_workloads[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads], update the `ClusterConfiguration` code to specify the Local Queue for the Ray cluster, as follows:
+
.Example local queue
[source,bash]
----
local_queue="local_queue_name"
----

** Set `instascale` to `False`.
ifndef::upstream[]
InstaScale is not deployed in the Technology Preview version of the distributed workloads feature.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
InstaScale is not deployed in the current version of the distributed workloads feature.
endif::[]
.. Run the notebooks.


.Verification
The notebooks run to completion without errors. In the notebooks, the output from the `cluster.status()` function or `cluster.details()` function indicates that the Ray cluster is `Active`.
