= Scheduling a pipeline run using a cron job

[role='_abstract']
You can use a cron job to schedule a pipeline run to execute at a specific time. Cron jobs are useful for creating periodic and recurring tasks, and can also schedule individual tasks for a specific time, such as if you want to schedule a run for a low activity period. To successfully execute runs in {productname-short}, you must use the supported format. See link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format[Cron Expression Format] for more information.

The following examples show the correct format:
