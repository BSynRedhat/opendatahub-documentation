= Using Hugging Face models with Guardrails Orchestrator


[role='_abstract']

We have seen how to configure the TrustyAI Guardrails Orchestrator service with in-built detectors (the regex detector example) and a custom detector (the HAP detector example). 

You can incorporate a subset of Hugging Face (HF) models as custom detectors with the Guardrails Orchestrator, which can be configured using a Hugging Face runtime. This subset of models are `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` models.

The following sections provide reference material you need and outlines for two scenarios, using a Prompt Injection detector as the example model. 

[NOTE]
--
Only the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` subset of Hugging Face models are compatible with the Guardrails Orchestrator.
