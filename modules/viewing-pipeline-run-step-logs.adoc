[role='_abstract']
To help you troubleshoot and audit your pipelines, you can review and analyze the log of each pipeline step using the log viewer. From here, you can search for specific log messages, download the logs for each step in your pipeline. If the pipeline is running, you can also pause and resume the log from the log viewer.
